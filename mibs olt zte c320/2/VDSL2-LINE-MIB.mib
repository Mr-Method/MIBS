   DESCRIPTION
        "
         This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB)
         module for use with network management protocols in the
         Internet community for the purpose of managing VDSL2, ADSL,
         ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines.

         The MIB module described in RFC 2662 [RFC2662] defines
         objects used for managing Asymmetric Bit-Rate DSL (ADSL)
         interfaces per [T1E1.413], [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].
         These object descriptions are based upon the specifications
         for the ADSL Embedded Operations Channel (EOC) as defined
         in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) T1E1.413
         [T1E1.413] and International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T)
         G.992.1 [G.992.1] and G.992.2 [G.992.2].

         The MIB module described in RFC 4706 [RFC4706] defines
         objects used for managing ADSL2 interfaces per [G.992.3]
         and [G.992.4], and ADSL2+ interfaces per [G.992.5]. That MIB
         is also capable of managing ADSL interfaces per [T1E1.413],
         [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].

         This document does not obsolete RFC 2662 [RFC2662] and
         RFC 4706 [RFC4706], but rather provides a more comprehensive
         management model that manages VDSL2 interfaces per G.993.2
         [G.993.2] as well as ADSL, ADSL2 and ADSL2+ technologies
         per T1E1.413, G.992.1, G.992.2, G.992.3, G.992.4, and
         G.992.5
         ([T1E1.413], [G.992.1], [G.992.2], [G.992.3], [G.992.4], and
         [G.992.5] respectively).

        Additionally, the management framework for VDSL2 lines
        specified by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum
        (DSLF) has been taken into consideration [TR-129].  That
        framework is based on ITU-T G.997.1 standard [G.997.1].

        The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2
        transmission, as discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 2863
        [RFC2863]) section of this document.

       xdsl2LineCnfgTemplate attribute.

       For example, a xDSL2 line may fallback to a template with a lower
       rate if the rate specified in the primary template cannot be
       achieved.

       The value of this object identifies a row in the xDSL2 Line
       Configuration Template Table, xdsl2LineConfTemplateTable.
       Any row in the xdsl2LineConfTemplateTable table may be used as a
       fallback template.

       If the xDSL2 line fails to operate using the fallback template
       then the primary template should be retried.
       The xTU-C should continue to alternate between the primary and
       fallback templates until one of them succeeds.

       If the value of this object is a zero-length string then no
       fallback template is defined and only the primary template will
       be used.

       Note that implementation of this object is not mandatory.
       If this object is not supported, any attempt to modify this

      "Request a bits per sub-carrier measurement to be made.

       A request for a bits per sub-carrier measurement is made
       by setting this attribute to the value of measure(2).
       Upon completion of the measurement request,
       the Access Node shall set this attribute to idle(1).

       Note that a bits per sub-carrier measurement is also
       performed during a line diagnostic procedure. This
       attribute provides an additional mechanism to fetch
       the bits per sub-carrier data. This additional
       mechanism is provided so that bits per sub-carrier
       data may be fetched without forcing the line into no
       power state. This is useful because the bits per
       sub-carrier allocation may be adjusted at show time
       due to rate adaption and bit swapping.

       The implementation of this additional mechanism for
       measuring bits per sub-carrier is not mandatory.

       The results of the bits per sub-carrier measurement are
       stored in xdsl2LineSegmentTable. The status of the bits
       per sub-carrier measurement is indicated by

   DESCRIPTION
      "The table xdsl2LineSegmentTable contains status
       parameters of VDSL2/ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ sub-carriers.
       The parameters in this table are updated when a
       measurement request is made using the
       xdsl2LineCmndConfBpsc attribute.

       Note that a bits per sub-carrier measurement is also
       performed during a line diagnostic procedure. This
       table provides an additional mechanism to fetch
       the bits per sub-carrier data. This additional
       mechanism is provided so that bits per sub-carrier
       data may be fetched without forcing the line into no
       power state. This is useful because the bits per
       sub-carrier allocation may be adjusted at show time
       due to rate adaption and bit swapping.

       The implementation of this additional mechanism for
       measuring bits per sub-carrier is not mandatory."

     This is a string of 16 pairs of values in the following
     structure:
     Octets 0+1 - Index of 1st sub-carrier used in the context
                  of a first breakpoint.
     Octet 2    - The PSD reduction for the sub-carrier indicated in
                  octets 0 and 1.
     Octets 3-5 - Same, for a 2nd breakpoint.
     Octets 6-8 - Same, for a 3rd breakpoint.
     This architecture continues until octets 9-47, which are
     associated with a 16th breakpoint.
     Each subcarrier index is an unsigned number in the range 1 and
     NSCus.  Each PSD reduction value is in the range 0 (0dBm/Hz) to
     255 (-127.5dBm/Hz) with steps of 0.5dBm/Hz.  Valid values are
     in the range 0 to 190 (0 to -95dBm/Hz).
     When the number of breakpoints is less than 16, all remaining
     octets are set to the value 0.  Note that the content of this
     object should be correlated with the sub-carriers mask and with
     the RFI setup. "
