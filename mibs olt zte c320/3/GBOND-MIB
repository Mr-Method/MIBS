         multi-pair bonded xDSL Interfaces, defined in ITU-T
         recommendations G.998.1, G.998.2 and G.998.3.

         This MIB module MUST be used in conjunction with a bonding

          It is RECOMMENDED that a small debouncing period of 2.5 sec,
          between the detection of the condition and notification,

          gBondLowUpRateCrossing notifications to be sent.

          The adaptive nature of the G.Bond technology allows the port
          to adapt itself to the changes in the copper environment,
          e.g., an impulse noise, alien crosstalk, or a
          micro-interruption may temporarily drop one or more BCEs in
          the aggregation group, causing a rate degradation of the

          Writing a non-zero value to this object results in a
          Discovery Set_if_Clear operation.
          A zero-length octet string SHALL be returned on an attempt to
          read this object when GAF aggregation is not enabled.

          This object is irrelevant in BCE-R port subtypes (CPE side):
          in this case a zero length octet string SHALL be returned on
          an attempt to read this object, writing to this object SHALL
          be rejected.

          Discovery MUST be performed when the link is Down.
          Attempts to change this object MUST be rejected (in case of
          SNMP with the error inconsistentValue), if the link is Up or
          Initializing.

          This object maps to the WT-159 attribute
